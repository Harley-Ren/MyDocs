# Grammar in Use

## Unit 56

### Remember

**Remember doing**

**I remember doing something =**

I did it and now I remember this.

You remember doing something after you have done it.

**I remember to do something** =

I remembered that I had to do it, so I did it .

You remember to do something before you do it.

要记住 不定式有未来的意思。

### Regret

**I regret doing** something =

I dit it, and I’m sorry I dit it:

I now regret saying what I said. I shouldn’t have said it.

**I regret to say something** =

I’m sorry that I have to say it:

```
I regret to say we are unable to accept your offer.
```

**I regret to say** is a *formal* way to say **I’m sorry to say**

### Go on

go on 后面可以接不定式和ing，意思不同。

**Go on doing** something = 

continue doing it。 也就是继续做某事。

```
The president paused for a moment and then went on talking
```

Go on to do something =  do or say something new.  

是指停下原来的事儿，继续做另外一件事儿。

```
After discussing the economy, the president the went on to talk about forgein policy.
```

### being start continue intend bother

这些动词后面接  `-ing` 或是 `to...`  没有意思上的区别。

```
It started raining
or
It started to rain.
```

We prefer not to use `-ing` + `-ing`. 所以如果上面的名子为现在时态时，So we say:

```
It's starting to rain.
```

not prefer:

```
It's starting raining
```

## Unit 57

### try to ... and try + -ing

**try to do =** attempt to do ,make an effort to do:

尝试做、努力做；

```

```

**Try** something /  **try doing** something =  do something as a test.做某事以测试。

```
These cakes are delicious. You should try one.
(= you should have one to see if you like it.)
```

### need to ... and need + -ing

**I need to do** something = it is necessary for me to do it:

```

```

something **needs doing**  = it needs to be done.

(= It needs to be charged)
```

or

重点是  **I can't help doing** something.  意思是忍不住、情不自禁做某事。这个在高中时候学过的。

```

## Unit 58 : Verb + -ing or to ... 3

### like,love and hate

### I like living here.

当我们说某个**已存在**的situation时，用 **-ing** (not **to ...**)。

(= he lives there now and he likes it.)

I like to do 和 I like doing还有另一个区别。

```

```

```

## Unit 59: prefer and would rather

### prefer to ... and prefer + -ing

When you say what you prefer in general, you can say:

当你说你**一般**喜欢什么的时候，你可以说：

I **prefer to do** something

or 

I **prefer doing** something.

这时用 `prefer to ...`  或是 `prefer + -ing` 都OK。

I don't like cities.

I **prefer to live** in the country.

or 

I **prefer living** in the country.

当我们说喜欢某物胜过另一物时用： **prefer ... to ...**

```
I prefer this coat to the other one
```

当我们说喜欢做一件事胜过另一件事儿时，有两种表达方式：

1. **prefer doing** one thing **to doing** another.
   
   请注意，这里已经有 to 后面接ing的例子了，所以说**to后面并不是一定要接动词原形的。**
   
   I prefer **driving to travelling** by train.

2. **prefer to do** one thing **rather than do** another.
   
   要注意，prefer to do 因为已经有了一个`to`,所以后面不能再接一个to了，所以英文里用的是 rather than do. rather than 后面接的是原形哦。
   
   I prefer **to drive rather than travel** by train.
   
   Sarah prefers **to live** in the country **rather than** in a city.
   
   请注意第二名，全句应该是 Sarah prefers **to live** in the country **rather than** (live) in a city. 因为两个动词一样，所以省略了rather than 后面的live.

### would prefer

我们用would prefer来表达特定情况下有人想要什么（ not in general)

```
A: Would you prefer tea or coffee?
B: Coffee, please.
```

我们用would prefer to do 来表达特定情况下有人想要**做**什么

A:  Shall we go by train?

B: **I'd prefer to drive.**

### I'd rather ...

**I'd rather do** something = **I'd prefer to do** it. 

注意： I'd rather do (not **to do**)

A: Shall we go by train?

B: I'd **rather drive.**

or

I'd **prefer to drive**.

当我们用rather来表达喜欢做某事胜过做某事时，用：

I'd rather do one thing than do another. 也就是  rather  than的语法。

**I'd rather stay** at home tonight **than go** to the cinema.

### I'd rather you

**I'd rather you did** something 这里you后面的动词要用过去式。

(not I'd rather you **do**)

A: Who's going to drive , you or me ?

B: I'd rather you drove. (= I would prefer this.)

We use the past (**drove/did/told**), but the meaning is *present* not past.

否定的时候用 I'd rather you didn't do something.

I'd rather you didn't tell anyone what I said.

(=please don't tell anyone)

## Unit 60  Preposition + -ing

介词后面跟动词时，动词用 **-ing** 形式。

Are you interestied **in working** for us ?

## Unit 61 I'm use to ...

这一节比较简单， 这个知识点在高就比较熟悉。

I'm used to someting/doing something  是我熟悉某东西/做某事。

当我们说`I'm used to ...` 时，这时的`to`是介词，所以后面的动词用`-ing`。

I used to do是我过去常常做某事儿（现在不这样做了。）
